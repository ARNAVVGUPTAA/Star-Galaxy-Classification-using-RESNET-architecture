# Star-Galaxy-Classification-using-RESNET-architecture

The project contains a Deep Convolutional Neural Network trained on the dataset:

I was able to achieve an AUC_SCORE of 0.97 suggesting the model is working remarkably well for the given dataset.


With so many layers and to prevent overfitting (also to practice and understand the architecture), I was able to implement the ResNet architecture in the Neural Network, as seen in the model architecture layout:
